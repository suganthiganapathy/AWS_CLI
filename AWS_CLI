I have installed and configured the AWS CLI on a Red Hat Linux instance because this instance type does not have the AWS CLI pre-installed. Some instance types, such as Amazon Linux, do come pre-installed with the AWS CLI. 
To create a AWS CLI I have followed few steps

STEP:1
For Installing AWS cli to Red hat Linux instance:

1) Curl cmd to download the file to current directory: curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
2) to unlock the zip file: unzip -u awscliv2.zip 
3) To install the program sudo command grants the write permission to the directory: sudo ./aws/install
4)To find Aws cli version : aws --version

STEP:2
Observe IAM Details in AWS management console:
 In IAM users find the user access key
5) To configure the cli to Aws account: aws configure
after configure file up the following: access key id, secret access key, default region name and output format 

STEP:3
Observe configuration details through AWS CLI
6) to find the list of users:aws iam list-users
7)to list down the policy details: aws iam list-policies --scope Local

8)to download the AWS policy document to a json format IAM document:aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::038946776283:policy/lab_policy --version-id v1 > lab_policy.json
